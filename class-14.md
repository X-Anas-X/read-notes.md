# _Transforms:_
- With ***CSS3*** transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
-  Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes.
+ It is important to note, not all properties may be transitiWorking with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elementsoned.
- Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
+  the default transform origin is the dead center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically. 
- Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements
- When working with three-dimensional transforms, elements will occasionally be transformed in a way that causes them to face away from the screen
- The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration.
- Once the keyframes for an animation have been declared they need to be assigned to an element.
- Fortunately animations, just like transitions, can be written out in a shorthand format.
