# _chapter 5:_
-Document Object Model DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
- DOM is not part of HTML or part of JavaScript.. it is a separate set of rules. It exists in all major browser makers.
+ The  DOM tree is a model of a web page.
* Each node is an object with methods and properties. 
>* DOM trees have four types of nodes: 
>> document nodes.
>> element nodes.
>> attribute nodes.
>> text nodes. 
- Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 
- Using the innerHTML property you can access and amend the contents of an element including any child elements.
- DOM manipulation can be used to remove elements from the DOM tree.
- If you add HTML to a page using i nnerHTML you need to be aware of CrossSite Scripting Attacks or XSS; otherwise an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts.

## What is the hardest thing about writing code?
> There are many common answers to this question:
1. Learning a new technology
2. Naming things
3. Testing your code
4. Debugging
5. Fixing bugs
6. Making software maintainable
-  we keep demonstrating how to build the same simple application over and over again in each of our courses.
> the answer is familiarity.
- By creating a familiar problem domain.. both the tasks of teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier.
- Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain.
- It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking you understand enough of the problem to get started coding it.
