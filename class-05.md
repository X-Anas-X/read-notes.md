# HTML & CSS:
# _Chapter 5:_
> <img> 
- To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element.
- the align attribute is no longer used in HTML5.
- The most popular tool amongst web professionals is Adobe Photoshop.
* The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.
+ When cropping images it is important not to **lose** valuable information.
- _**Photographs**_ should be saved as JPEGs, illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.


# _Chapter 11:_
- The ***color*** property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
+ Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green and blue. 
-  the opacity allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values with an optional opacity value.


# _Chapter 12:_
- When choosing a typeface it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that
user's computer.
* Typefaces are subject to copyright, so the techniques you can choose from are limited by their respective licenses.
+ The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options but you need to have the right license
to use them.
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text or when they have visited a link.
