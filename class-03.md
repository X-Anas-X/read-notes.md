# HTML & CSS:

### __chapter 3:__
- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered and definition.
- _**Ordered lists**_ <ol> are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
- _**Unordered lists**_ <ul> are lists that begin with a bullet point.
- _**Definition lists**_ <dl> are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

# _Chapter 13:_
> Box Dimensions 
>- (div.box)
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
- By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. 
- To set dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.
- you can hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders to help decorating the webpage.

#JavaScript:

### _Chapter 4:_
> Decisions and Loops
- Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and the browser window itself.
+ The operand does not have to be single value or variable name.
* The if statement evaluates a condition wither if it's true or not.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do.
